# Custom Blockchain & Crypto Currency Implementation

## What Is This?

This is a toy blockchain implementation running on a custom blockchain protocol.

The goal of this implementation is to illustrate the intuition behind:

- Blockchain
- Cryptocurrency Implementation
- Smart Contract Implementation
- Understanding P2P Decentralization
- Consensus Algorithms

### Running Locally
pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure the dir can be found on your `PYTHON_PATH`

`export FLASK_APP=server.py`
`cd src/server && flask run`

You can hit the node and have nodes join the p2p network via `curl` or `postman`.
